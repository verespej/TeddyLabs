Most items have international shipping prices listed, or please ask for a quote.\r\n\r\nCAN YOU SHIP MY ITEMS TOGETHER FOR LESS?\r\nYes, usually when you purchase multiple items, shipping is automatically discounted and combined.  \r\n\r\nCAN I ADD INSURANCE?\r\nYes, please ask for an adjusted shipping quote if you would like to add insurance to your package.  We do NOT normally include insurance.  In the extremely unlikely event of a lost or stolen package (this has happened only once in 3,000+ packages), Quietude Quilts cannot be responsible for replacing the missing items.  If you feel more peace of mind by having your item insured, it is usually just a couple dollars for most items.","policy_refunds":"","policy_additional":"ARE ALL COLORS, QUANTITIES, AND ITEMS IN STOCK AND READY TO SHIP?\r\nYes, and no.  All furniture is in stock and if you purchase painting will be painted to your selection.  A small amount of every bedding item is also in stock, but if you select a high quantity of identical items, extra production time may be required and we will contact you if this will affect your shipping time.\r\n\r\nDO YOU TAKE RETURNS?\r\nNo, not normally but we understand there can be extenuating circumstances.  We can not take returns of furniture that has been assembled.\r\n\r\nDO YOU TAKE CUSTOM ORDERS?\r\nNo, we are not currently offering custom orders. \r\n\r\nDO YOU SELL WHOLESALE?\r\nNo, we are not currently offering wholesale orders.\r\n\r\nDO YOU SEND FREE ITEMS TO PHOTOGRAPHERS OR GIVE DISCOUNTS IN EXCHANGE FOR PHOTOS?\r\nNo, and yes.  Our primary customers are photographers and many of them are so kind to send us amazing photos of our products in use.  After you become one of our customers and share photos using our props, our relationship often develops towards future great discounts and possible photo/prop exchanges.\r\n\r\nPhotographers, thank you for your generosity and sharing that helps us keep our prices so affordable!  When you post, tag, email, or message your beautiful photos using our products to us or our facebook page, you allow Quietude Quilts to use them in advertising or our shop.  \r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER COUPONS ON YOUR FURNITURE?\r\nNo, but we do offer occasional coupons for bedding and other items.  Any coupons should always include the information that they do not apply to our beds, but we&#39;re posting that policy here in case it is ever accidentally omitted.  Thank you for understanding the time that our handcrafted woodworking takes and that we keep our prices as low as possible for everyday.  Coupons also do not apply to customized orders, items being held on reserve, or past orders.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1377868863,"vacation_autoreply":"Quietude Quilts is taking a break as we finish preparing for and happily welcome our first baby in February!  \r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and great support over the past three years - we look forward to returning after a maternity & paternity break, and continuing to supply you with baby beds and doll furniture, newborn props and wooden and quilted toys!\r\n\r\nKelsey and Jonathan\r\nQuietudeQuilts.etsy.com\r\nfacebook.com/QuietudeQuilts ","url":"http://www.etsy.com/shop/QuietudeQuilts?utm_source=teddylabs&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/0/iusb_760x100.8128671.jpg","num_favorers":3597,"has_tax_preferences":true,"languages":["en-US"]}},{"listing_id":156695652,"state":"active","user_id":29407579,"category_id":68889226,"title":"Ring Bearer Gift, Teddy Bear, Personalized Gift","description":"This sweet little Ring Bearer Teddy Bear wears a custom knit tuxedo sweater in your choice of color.

If you do not see what you are looking for, please message us or call 785.856.HOOP!  \r\n \r\nWHAT SIZE HOOP SHOULD I CHOOSE?\r\nWhen choosing a hoop, we usually recommend that you measure from the ground up to about 1-2” above your belly button. Some beginners like hoops around belly button height and some like larger hoops, all the way up to chest height.   Beginners will appreciate larger hoops so if this is your first hoop, remember that bigger is better!  The larger a hoop is, the slower it will rotate around the body, making learning new moves easier.   As you become more comfortable with hooping and are starting to build up a repertoire of tricks, you may want to slowly downsize to a smaller hoop for increased range of moves and faster speeds.  If you are a new hooper who is still unsure of the size of hoop that’s right for you, please message, call or email us your height and weight to info@hoopmamas.net and we will recommend a size for you. \r\n\r\nSHOULD I CHOOSE 100psi (Standard) or 160psi (Heavyweight)?\r\nWe usually recommend 100psi because it is the current standard weight in Hoopdance Hoops, but here are some other helpful guidelines:\r\n\r\n*Reasons to choose the 160psi weight:  \r\n     ~You have tried a friend&#39;s hoop, but can&#39;t seem to keep it up successfully.\r\n     ~You are heavy-set or large framed and are looking for a hoop for weight loss.\r\n     ~You are interested in waist hooping for exercise, but not necessarily any body tricks and moves.\r\n\r\n*Reasons to choose the 100psi weight:\r\n     ~You have successfully waist hooped with a friend&#39;s hoop.\r\n     ~You are naturally athletic and learn new activities easily.\r\n     ~You are interested in learning the tricks & moves associated with Hoopdance.\r\n     \r\nSidenote:  There has always been talk of a heavier hoop being a better workout, although this is absolutely untrue.  The heavier the hoop, the slower it roates, making it easier to learn on, but in turn burning less calories.  The faster your body has to move with a hoop, the better workout making lighter hoops (100psi) actually better for exercise.\r\n\r\nWILL I BE ABLE TO HOOP WITH YOUR HOOPS?\r\nYES!!!  All Hoop Mamas Hoops are constructed of weighted tubing that is heavier and much larger than ‘your mama’s hoops’!  These larger, heavier hoops will rotate around the body much slower, allowing everyone to be successful!  We also use grip tape on every one of our hoops which allows the hoop to literally stick to your hips!  No matter your size, weight, athletic ability OR sense of rhythm, you’ll be able to spin Hoop Mamas hoops!   \r\n\r\nHOW SHOULD I CARE FOR MY NEW HOOP?\r\nOur hoops are durable and professionally constructed so they should last a long time with proper care.  \r\n\r\n*Most important is WHERE you hoop.  If you hoop on grass, carpet, wood flooring or any other soft or smooth surface your hoop will be less likely to get scratched or damaged when it falls to the ground.  (And it WILL drop as you are learning)!  If your hoop is used on concrete, gravel or any other rough surface, it is likely to appear worn more quickly.  \r\n\r\n*Temperature is also important.  Hoops are made of plastic and when they get warm they can lose their shape.  Never leave your hoop in a hot car or outside on a hot day.  If this does occur, it&#39;s okay!  Hoops can be re-shaped!  Allow the hoop to warm up in the sunshine then take the hoop indoors to set on the floor.  Treat your hoop kindly and it should bring you joy for a long, long time!\r\n\r\nAll images on this site are the intellectual property of Alison Fitzgerald & Hoop Mamas, LLC.

","policy_additional":"FREQUESTLY ASKED QUESTIONS~\r\n\r\nHere you will find a list of the most common inquiries we receive.  If you do not see what you are looking for, please message us or call 785.856.HOOP!  \r\n \r\nWHAT SIZE HOOP SHOULD I CHOOSE?\r\nWhen choosing a hoop, we usually recommend that you measure from the ground up to about 1-2” above your belly button. Some beginners like hoops around belly button height and some like larger hoops, all the way up to chest height.   Beginners will appreciate larger hoops so if this is your first hoop, remember that bigger is better!  The larger a hoop is, the slower it will rotate around the body, making learning new moves easier.   As you become more comfortable with hooping and are starting to build up a repertoire of tricks, you may want to slowly downsize to a smaller hoop for increased range of moves and faster speeds.  If you are a new hooper who is still unsure of the size of hoop that’s right for you, please message, call or email us your height and weight to info@hoopmamas.net and we will recommend a size for you. \r\n\r\nSHOULD I CHOOSE 100psi (Standard) or 160psi (Heavyweight)?\r\nWe usually recommend 100psi because it is the current standard weight in Hoopdance Hoops, but here are some other helpful guidelines:\r\n\r\n*Reasons to choose the 160psi weight:  \r\n     ~You have tried a friend&#39;s hoop, but can&#39;t seem to keep it up successfully.\r\n     ~You are heavy-set or large framed and are looking for a hoop for weight loss.\r\n     ~You are interested in waist hooping for exercise, but not necessarily any body tricks and moves.\r\n\r\n*Reasons to choose the 100psi weight:\r\n     ~You have successfully waist hooped with a friend&#39;s hoop.\r\n     ~You are naturally athletic and learn new activities easily.\r\n     ~You are interested in learning the tricks & moves associated with Hoopdance.\r\n     \r\nSidenote:  There has always been talk of a heavier hoop being a better workout, although this is absolutely untrue.  The heavier the hoop, the slower it roates, making it easier to learn on, but in turn burning less calories.  The faster your body has to move with a hoop, the better workout making lighter hoops (100psi) actually better for exercise.\r\n\r\nWILL I BE ABLE TO HOOP WITH YOUR HOOPS?\r\nYES!!!  All Hoop Mamas Hoops are constructed of weighted tubing that is heavier and much larger than ‘your mama’s hoops’!  These larger, heavier hoops will rotate around the body much slower, allowing everyone to be successful!  We also use grip tape on every one of our hoops which allows the hoop to literally stick to your hips!  No matter your size, weight, athletic ability OR sense of rhythm, you’ll be able to spin Hoop Mamas hoops!   \r\n\r\nHOW SHOULD I CARE FOR MY NEW HOOP?\r\nOur hoops are durable and professionally constructed so they should last a long time with proper care.  \r\n\r\n*Most important is WHERE you hoop.  If you hoop on grass, carpet, wood flooring or any other soft or smooth surface your hoop will be less likely to get scratched or damaged when it falls to the ground.  (And it WILL drop as you are learning)!  If your hoop is used on concrete, gravel or any other rough surface, it is likely to appear worn more quickly.  \r\n\r\n*Temperature is also important.  Hoops are made of plastic and when they get warm they can lose their shape.  Never leave your hoop in a hot car or outside on a hot day.  If this does occur, it&#39;s okay!  Hoops can be re-shaped!  Allow the hoop to warm up in the sunshine then take the hoop indoors to set on the floor.  Treat your hoop kindly and it should bring you joy for a long, long time!\r\n\r\nAll images on this site are the intellectual property of Alison Fitzgerald & Hoop Mamas, LLC.

I would not have this rewarding creative outlet if it wasn&#39;t for them.\r\nI love the simplicity of wood toys. I believe that sometimes the simplest toys are the best toys.\r\nThe maple I use to make my toys is wonderful to work with, durable, beautiful and non toxic. All my toys are completely natural and are a safer alternative for our little ones.\r\nMy toys are environmentally friendly. The wood used to make my toys came from the earth and can become earth once again.\r\nAnd finally, I make toys because, of course, it&#39;s super fun! :o)\r\n\r\nHOW CAN I CONTACT YOU?\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/conversations/new?with=greenbeantoys\r\n","policy_payment":"WHAT PAYMENT METHODS CAN I USE?\r\nI accept credit cards through PayPal and Etsy.\r\n","policy_shipping":"HOW AND WHEN DO YOU SHIP?\r\nI ship all orders within 5 business days.  All my orders are shipped U.S. Priority (2-3 business days) or First Class mail (3-5 business days). \r\n\r\nWHAT ABOUT INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING?\r\nI ship all my international orders USPS First Class International. Unfortunately, tracking is unavailable for this method of shipping.  Please expect up to 2 weeks for delivery.\r\n\r\nMY ORDER IS A GIFT.  WILL YOU SEND AN ORDER DIRECTLY TO THE RECIPIENT AND INCLUDE A NOTE?                                                                   \r\nI’d be happy to!  Please provide the appropriate shipping address and be sure to include your message to the recipient in the “note to seller” section during the check out process.\r\n\r\nWHAT TYPE OF PACKAGING DO YOU USE?\r\nAll of my orders are sent in recyclable cardboard boxes. To add extra cushioning, I use a few different types of packaging papers. \r\n","policy_refunds":"It is my wish that you and your little one will be pleased with your purchase! If for any reason you are not satisfied, please feel free to convo or email me with any concerns. \r\nItems may be returned for a refund or exchange within 7 days.  Buyer is responsible for shipping.\r\n","policy_additional":"DO YOU OFFER DISCOUNTS IF I PURCHASE MULTIPLE ITEMS?\r\nOf course!  Are you interested in purchasing my toys as party favors?  I offer discounts on orders of 10 or more toys and even deeper discounts on any order of 20 or more toys.  Please convo me if you may be interested.\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/conversations/new?with=greenbeantoys\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER WHOLESALE?\r\nI am sorry.  I am unable to offer wholesale at this time.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I CARE FOR MY ITEMS?\r\nTo keep your wooden toys safe, clean and germ-free the natural way, wipe with a cloth or a sponge that has been dampened with a solution of vinegar and water.  Allow toys to dry completely before use.  A fine grade of sandpaper can be used to smooth away rough spots or remove tough stains.  Avoid excessive moisture.\r\n","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1337954157,"vacation_autoreply":"I am closed for Spring break, to spend some time with family and friends and to restock.  \r\nI&#39;ll be back on April 6.\r\nThank you so much for stopping in... :o)","url":"http://www.etsy.com/shop/GreenBeanToys?utm_source=teddylabs&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/0/iusb_760x100.9065583.jpg","num_favorers":1857,"has_tax_preferences":false,"languages":["en-US"]}},{"listing_id":158819479,"state":"active","user_id":34180339,"category_id":68901264,"title":"Wide Striped Navy and White Kids Teepee Tent, Play Tent, Custom Order, Poles Included","description":"This special teepee is navy and white stripes.

Sewing makes me happy and I love passing that on to all who purchase my clothing. \r\n\r\nI would like to thank all of my customers for all of their kind words and feedback and making this shop a reality for me!\r\n\r\nI am so happy that I am able to offer quality clothing at affordable prices.

Add any name to this kids teepee tent!  Big or small letters, long or short names, above the door flaps (as shown) or vertically along the edge of a door flap!  \r\n\r\nChoose from 14 different canvas colors for your teepee:  natural, white, hot pink, light pink, light blue, royal, red, orange, yellow, purple, turquoise, black, navy.  Canvas colors are shown in the last photo in this listing.  You can choose the color you would like the name to be, too!  Please continue reading for more information.\r\n\r\nYour teepee will be 50&quot; wide by 50&quot; deep at the base.  More than 4 feet wide and deep!!  These are the inside measurements of the teepee.  The outside measurements (from pole end to pole end) are about 4&quot; wider.  The teepee is 5 feet tall including poles when it is set up.  The poles are 6 feet tall.   This teepee is beautiful in any room in the house, in the yard, or at the beach or park for fun and shade!\r\n\r\nMy teepees are always shipped via USPS Priority Mail in a box that is specially made for my teepees!  Guaranteed to arrive safe and sound, and you can use the box for storage, if you want!  Or, just fold up the teepee and slide it under a bed or stand it in a corner until the next adventure begins.  These teepees have solid, 6 foot long, smoothly sanded poles that have been left unfinished for a timeless look. \r\n\r\nThis teepee looks just as good outside as it does inside!  All seams are turned under and professionally finished.  No exposed raw edges!  Great for photo props, too.  \r\n\r\nThese teepees do not have ribbon tie backs or button tie backs.  The canvas is very thick, and does not &quot;drape&quot; nicely when it is tied back.  My kids and the kids in our neighborhood have tested the canvas teepees extensively, and I have found that they usually just fold the doors back when using the canvas teepees.  The poles are tied together with heavy duty leather lacing.  \r\n\r\nThis teepee is absolutely suitable for outdoor or indoor use.  Please remember to bring your teepee indoors during inclement or very windy weather and overnight.  Yes, canvas can be machine washed, but it you love the look and feel of heavy canvas, dry cleaning or spot washing is best.  Machine washing softens the canvas and makes it more pliable.  Complete care instructions are included with your teepee.\r\n\r\n****************************************************************************************************************\r\nWhen you check out, please do the following:\r\n\r\n1.  Choose your canvas color from the drop down menu.\r\n2.  Choose the name position from the drop down menu.   (Either above the door flaps, or vertically along the edge of one of the door flaps).\r\n3.  Add the teepee to your cart.\r\n4.  Leave the name and the fabric color you would like the name to be in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; when you check out.  Choose any color for the name!  I will find a suitable cotton print in that color.\r\n******************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nPlease see my shop announcement for custom order teepee construction time.  It varies, but is usually about 2-3 weeks.\r\n\r\nI can ship this teepee internationally without poles, including instructions on making the poles yourself.

","policy_additional":"FREQUESTLY ASKED QUESTIONS~\r\n\r\nHere you will find a list of the most common inquiries we receive.  If you do not see what you are looking for, please message us or call 785.856.HOOP!  \r\n \r\nWHAT SIZE HOOP SHOULD I CHOOSE?\r\nWhen choosing a hoop, we usually recommend that you measure from the ground up to about 1-2” above your belly button. Some beginners like hoops around belly button height and some like larger hoops, all the way up to chest height.   Beginners will appreciate larger hoops so if this is your first hoop, remember that bigger is better!  The larger a hoop is, the slower it will rotate around the body, making learning new moves easier.   As you become more comfortable with hooping and are starting to build up a repertoire of tricks, you may want to slowly downsize to a smaller hoop for increased range of moves and faster speeds.  If you are a new hooper who is still unsure of the size of hoop that’s right for you, please message, call or email us your height and weight to info@hoopmamas.net and we will recommend a size for you. \r\n\r\nSHOULD I CHOOSE 100psi (Standard) or 160psi (Heavyweight)?\r\nWe usually recommend 100psi because it is the current standard weight in Hoopdance Hoops, but here are some other helpful guidelines:\r\n\r\n*Reasons to choose the 160psi weight:  \r\n     ~You have tried a friend&#39;s hoop, but can&#39;t seem to keep it up successfully.\r\n     ~You are heavy-set or large framed and are looking for a hoop for weight loss.\r\n     ~You are interested in waist hooping for exercise, but not necessarily any body tricks and moves.\r\n\r\n*Reasons to choose the 100psi weight:\r\n     ~You have successfully waist hooped with a friend&#39;s hoop.\r\n     ~You are naturally athletic and learn new activities easily.\r\n     ~You are interested in learning the tricks & moves associated with Hoopdance.\r\n     \r\nSidenote:  There has always been talk of a heavier hoop being a better workout, although this is absolutely untrue.  The heavier the hoop, the slower it roates, making it easier to learn on, but in turn burning less calories.  The faster your body has to move with a hoop, the better workout making lighter hoops (100psi) actually better for exercise.\r\n\r\nWILL I BE ABLE TO HOOP WITH YOUR HOOPS?\r\nYES!!!  All Hoop Mamas Hoops are constructed of weighted tubing that is heavier and much larger than ‘your mama’s hoops’!  These larger, heavier hoops will rotate around the body much slower, allowing everyone to be successful!  We also use grip tape on every one of our hoops which allows the hoop to literally stick to your hips!  No matter your size, weight, athletic ability OR sense of rhythm, you’ll be able to spin Hoop Mamas hoops!   \r\n\r\nHOW SHOULD I CARE FOR MY NEW HOOP?\r\nOur hoops are durable and professionally constructed so they should last a long time with proper care.  \r\n\r\n*Most important is WHERE you hoop.  If you hoop on grass, carpet, wood flooring or any other soft or smooth surface your hoop will be less likely to get scratched or damaged when it falls to the ground.  (And it WILL drop as you are learning)!  If your hoop is used on concrete, gravel or any other rough surface, it is likely to appear worn more quickly.  \r\n\r\n*Temperature is also important.  Hoops are made of plastic and when they get warm they can lose their shape.  Never leave your hoop in a hot car or outside on a hot day.  If this does occur, it&#39;s okay!  Hoops can be re-shaped!  Allow the hoop to warm up in the sunshine then take the hoop indoors to set on the floor.  Treat your hoop kindly and it should bring you joy for a long, long time!\r\n\r\nAll images on this site are the intellectual property of Alison Fitzgerald & Hoop Mamas, LLC.

It may be sooner, but equally, if I get a tidal wave of orders all coming in at once, it may be close to the 8 week mark.

You may call me Mrs McGettrick. \r\n\r\nWant to become a fan? Follow me on facebook:\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/pages/Mrs-McGettricks-Fuggler-Emporium/155586247827539\r\n\r\nBe nice enough, and you&#39;ll probably get a Fuggler named after you :)\r\n\r\n SMALL PRINT: Mrs McGettrick&#39;s Fugglers are not suitable for small/medium/oral fixated children, as there is a risk that small parts could come loose and present a choking hazard. Colours may vary from the photographs, due to monitor settings, flash, and my inability to use a camera. Mrs McGettrick&#39;s Fugglers are made in a house containing a cat.

She&#39;s it, but only if you can catch her!\r\n\r\nOur waldorf wooden cheetah toy is 5 3/4 inches long and 1 3/4 inches tall.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur waldorf - style toys all begin as hand-drawn patterns unique to Outside Everywhere. The patterns are then transferred onto poplar wood and cut out in our home-workshop. We use sustainably-harvested wood, and local wood when it’s available. Our toys are sanded multiple times with several different sandpapers to ensure that our toys are super-smooth. All edges and corners are rounded to make them safe for little hands. Once our toys are smooth, we use high-quality AP certified non-toxic watercolor paints. Watercolors are amazing because they add color, but still allow the natural, beautiful grain of the wood to show through. As a safe, natural finish, we use our sweet-smelling homemade wood cream made from local beeswax and jojoba oil. Our toys will arrive to you in a small sewn eco-felt bag wrapped with string.

Our toys are sanded multiple times with several different sandpapers to ensure that our toys are super-smooth. All edges and corners are rounded to make them safe for little hands. Once our toys are smooth, we use high-quality AP certified non-toxic watercolor paints. Watercolors are amazing because they add color, but still allow the natural, beautiful grain of the wood to show through. As a safe, natural finish, we use our sweet-smelling homemade wood cream made from local beeswax and jojoba oil.  Our toys will arrive to you in a small sewn eco-felt bag wrapped with string.
