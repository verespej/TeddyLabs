Even if I have to stay up past my bedtime. Sometimes I am faster with my shipping.\r\n\r\nPlease note ---that the OCT-Christmas period order volumes increases and shipping speeds from USPS slow down. These two combine  into slower shipping times. Please allow plenty of time during this period.\r\n\r\nShipping prices quoted are first class mail and first class international.

If there is a reason that I am the cause of the delay, I will issue a refund when the item is returned to me.\r\n\r\nRefunds are not available for misuse of the cookie cutters.  I list what each cutter is made of, so you know how to treat them.  Tin cutters will rust if you place them in the dishwasher or sink.  Rinse off the cutters and place in a warm oven to thoroughly dry.  Stainless  cutters do not rust.  Colored Polyresin cutters are tin cutters with a coating of polyresin.  This coating will prevent rust unless there is damaged to the coating.And of course,  plastic cutters do not rust.\r\n\r\nPlease look at the photos before purchase.

Please be kind to yourself and me by giving us plenty of time.  I will do my best to get it to you.  \r\nBut remember I do not control the post office.  When you are in a rush it seems that the post office likes to taunt you and take what seems (but isn&#39;t really) to be longer to deliver the package.  \r\n\r\n Life is busy for all of us.  Please give every group enough time to get their job completed and get your cookie cutter to you.

Please contact me for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am in Kansas City, Missouri area. Yep, there are two Kansas Cities and both are in the central timezone.  \r\n A bit of silly info-There is still somewhat a border war going on here.  Kansas people don&#39;t like to be referred to as being from Missouri and visa versa for the MO people.    Both cities blend into one big city.  Of course everyone out of town thinks we are all in KS.   Even some of my out of town relatives think I live in KS.\r\n","policy_seller_info":"Deb Worley\r\nrgwsbs@hotmail.com  This is my email, but I get a large quantity of emails.

Cloth pads are something I&#39;m very passionate about. I originally tried them in college to be environmentally friendly, but discovered quickly that eco-friendliness is just one of the many benefits of using cloth pads! They are much more comfortable and breathable than plastic disposable pads, and are completely chemical-free. Better for your body, better for your wallet, better for the environment, and, of course, better for the small businesses that craft them with care! I hope that you will consider trying them, even if you decide not to buy them from my store.","policy_payment":"","policy_shipping":"Please allow two weeks for us to handmake your order.

However, customer satisfaction is very important to us, so if you are experiencing problems with our product, please contact us! We will do our best to work with you to find a satisfactory solution.","policy_additional":"Pad FAQs\r\n\r\nHow do Mama D&#39;s pads work?\r\n\r\nMy pads are considered envelope-style pads because they feature an outer layer, or envelope, and removable inner absorbent inserts. The envelope cover features wings that snap closed, so it as easy to put on as a disposable pad. \r\n\r\nThe advantages of the envelope design are that the absorbency level is fully customizable this way (use the same kind of pad throughout the entire period and customize it was you need to, as opposed to buying and sorting many pads with different absorbencies). Depending on how heavy your flow is at any particular time, you can add or remove inserts for customizable absorbency! Also, since it comes apart into smaller elements, it can be more effectively cleaned.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I offer two different kinds of pads: the Day Pad and the MiniPad. The Day Pad is constructed envelope-style and is ideal for normal daytime absorbency needs. The MiniPad is smaller and in one piece. It is a little more heavy-duty than a typical cloth panty liner, but with less bulk than the Day Pad-- this makes it ideal as backup for a menstrual cup! Mama D&#39;s Closet is also currently in the process of designing an excellent overnight pad, so be on the lookout for its appearance in the shop!\r\n\r\nMama D&#39;s pads feature vibrant flannel on the outside, and thirsty microfiber at the core of the inserts.\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n\r\n~What does cloth have to offer that disposables don&#39;t?\r\n\r\nSavings-- When you buy disposables, you are literally throwing your money in the trash, every month, for decades. Cloth pads last for years and offer a substantial financial advantage.\r\n\r\nPersonal Comfort-- There is a reason that we wear cotton clothing instead of plastic clothes! It is way more comfortable, softer, and more breathable. The same holds true for pads! One lovely bonus to using cloth is that you will avoid the chafing and itching that often occurs at the end of a period, after living in plastic for a week. :-)\r\n\r\nLess chemical exposure-- Some women find that they bleed and cramp less when using cloth. The prevailing theory is that this is the result of your body not having to contend with the chemicals typically found in disposable pads and tampons. Also- prepare to be shocked!- I have found that you will run into FEWER odor issues with cloth... blood interacting with disposable chemicals tends to produce some weird smells.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental friendliness-- Cloth pads don&#39;t take up space in landfills, don&#39;t require large amounts of chemicals and energy to produce, and don&#39;t cause emissions from being processed and delivered every single month.\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\n~What do I need to use cloth pads full-time?\r\n\r\nTo figure out how many pads you&#39;ll need, think about how often you plan on doing pad laundry during your period. The fewer times you plan on washing, the more pads you will need to buy. The great thing about envelope-style pads is that they clean up well with hand washing, so if you are in a dorm or shared laundry facility-type laundry situation, you can get by without going to the laundromat multiple times during your period! \r\n\r\nMy recommended amount of pads per day is 5-6 day pads and 1 night pad. For lighter days, 3 panty liners ought to do the trick (or 3 panty liners per any day for a menstrual cup user). \r\n\r\nIf you plan on going out and about, you&#39;ll need something to store your used pads in. If you&#39;re on a budget, ziploc bags work fine, but if you have cash to spare, I recommend using a wet bag. Mama D&#39;s currently does not offer wet bags for sale, but you can find them from many other Etsy businesses. I personally recommend Green Bumkin&#39;s shop (http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/greenbumkin?section_id=7493025).\r\n\r\n******************************************\r\n\r\nHow do I launder cloth pads?\r\n\r\nHere is what I have found to be the best laundering method: pre-soak in cold water in a small container, changing the water every several hours or so. Adding 1\/4 tsp Borax to the soak water will greatly help reduce staining. If it&#39;s going to be a couple days until you wash them, you can let them air dry after they&#39;re done soaking. On laundry day, wash on cold (I throw mine in with the rest of my laundry) and air dry. Under NO circumstances should you use fabric softener on your pads! Fabric softener will coat the pads and make them repel liquid. Many women prefer to wash their pads on a hot wash cycle; if you go this route, be aware that washing on hot and drying on the dryer may cause a greater likelihood of permanent staining and shorter lifespan of the pad. Just do what works best for you, and I promise that the pad police won&#39;t be coming after you. :-)\r\n\r\n***************************************\r\n\r\nWhat about stains?\r\n\r\nStains won&#39;t hinder the pad&#39;s ability to absorb, but keeping pads as pretty as possible is important to many women. Pre-soaking really is key to keeping pads looking their best. From several years&#39; personal experience, I can tell you that with a good soaking\/cold wash regimen, pads don&#39;t hold on to stains-- lighter-colored fabrics DO tend to look dingy after a while, but I have yet to get a splotchy-looking pad (and this is even after several months of throwing them in with my son&#39;s cloth diaper laundry on hot).\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\n~What kind of soaking container should I use?\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, anything that holds water will do the trick! I like to use repurposed plastic food or detergent containers because you can easily toss\/recycle them later. A lid is a nice feature in case you want to agitate the water a bit, but I strongly recommend that you leave the lid off during soaking time to let the pads breathe and avoid odors!\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\n\r\n~Do you do custom orders?\r\n\r\nI love to help customers get exactly what they&#39;re looking for! Are you on the hunt for a certain color, a special size, a different material, or some sort of pad-related thing that isn&#39;t found in my shop? Convo me with your wishes, and I&#39;ll see what I can do to make your dreams come true. ;-)","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1369662235,"vacation_autoreply":"","url":"http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/MamaDsCloset?utm_source=teddylabs&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/6122346\/iusb_760x100.9574708_1um6.jpg","num_favorers":181,"has_tax_preferences":false,"languages":["en-US","fr"]}},{"listing_id":151571248,"state":"active","user_id":20167557,"category_id":68902720,"title":"Pink Chain Stockings Doll Stockings Barbie and Silkstone Barbie 11 1\/2&quot;","description":"These stockings will fit Barbie and Silkstone Barbie 11 1\/2&quot;\r\n\r\nCustom Made Doll Stockings\r\n\r\nThe Daughter Who Sews provides extreme doll accessories for a variety of doll types.

Most offered stockings are made from 4way high stretch fabric and conform to the doll&#39;s leg shape. 4way stretch fabric allows for slightly higher or lower vertical stocking adjustments. Also, 4way stretch allows for the doll enthusiast&#39;s horizontal adjustment and gives the stockings an exact symmetry.\r\n\r\nTDWS provides a 100% satisfaction guarantee and will refund or exchange, upon the item(s) return.\r\n\r\nWhile we pre-wash all fabric prior to cutting, we do recommend that you rinse brightly hued items to insure that no dye remains. When brightly hued fabrics are left on dolls for extended wear from any product (dresses, pants, stockings, gloves, hats, ect.) there is always the chance that any remaining dye could mark the plastic. This is an unpredictable occurrence, so we do urge all doll owners to change their dolls outfits and accessories frequently to avoid any possible staining from any product. \r\n\r\nPayment & Shipping Information\r\n\r\nThe Daughter Who Sews now accepts Visa and Mastercard at Etsy check out!

Make as many as you are personally capable of. Sew for your friends. Sew for your shop. Sew for craft fairs and bazaars. Sew up a storm! Of course there are terms. But not that many:\r\n\r\n- A reminder that the copyright on my patterns still stands: That is, you may not copy, resell, share, distribute or publish (online or otherwise) any portion of any of my patterns without prior permission from me. Period. Basically anything that involves sharing any part of my patterns with anyone else is a no-no.\r\n\r\n- Each sewer must purchase a pattern for themselves. If you have a friend who is interested in partnering up with you, or you are hosting a craft party, please refer each of them to my blog or shop to purchase their own pattern. Thank you! (Exceptions may be made in the case of charitable sewing, just be sure to check with me first!)\r\n\r\n-Production is limited. To honor the &#39;no mass production&#39; spirit, please limit your listings (or display in your booth) no more than ten MmmCrafts items at a time. This means a total of ten of any pattern combination, for instance 6 Mikey Monkeys + 4 Baby Binky Bunnies = limit of ten. \r\n\r\n- Include credit where it&#39;s due. Please list a credit for the pattern on each listing and also on each hang tag for the item: Pattern by Larissa Holland, mmmcrafts.blogspot.com or something like that.\r\n\r\n- Minor derivatives are ok, but even if you make changes in the way a pattern is made, please still give a credit to me for the pattern, along with a note that it is a variation.\r\n\r\n- PLEASE NOTE that it is really really really NOT OK to use any of my photos, images, logos, badges, or graphics to promote your site or booth on signs, flyers, tags, headers, etc... Don&#39;t do it! Those images are copyrighted.\r\n\r\nJudging from the number of requests I get, there are a lot of readers out there who don&#39;t have the time or inclination to sew for themselves and they would appreciate knowing where to find your MmmCrafts handmade items.

(All receipts are sent electronically to the buyer, so your package will not include any paper receipts.)\r\n\r\nIS DELIVERY CONFIRMATION AVAILABLE?\r\nYes, for orders shipping within the US we provide delivery confirmation free of charge.  For international orders, package tracking is only available if you upgrade to Priority Mail International (ask us for details before purchasing).\r\n\r\nCAN I PAY EXTRA TO ADD PACKAGE TRACKING \/ INSURANCE TO MY INTERNATIONAL ORDER?  \r\nYes. We can upgrade your shipping method to Priority International.  This method offers package tracking and estimated (but NOT guaranteed) delivery in 6-10 business days. Or, you can purchase package insurance for either First Class or Priority International.  If you&#39;d like to upgrade, contact us BEFORE ordering.\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU PACKAGE YOUR ITEMS FOR SHIPPING?\r\nWe ship in recycled, eco-friendly cardboard boxes and padded envelopes. For void fill, we normally use natural brown paper reclaimed from local businesses. We sometimes re-use bubble wrap or air pockets (also reclaimed from local sources). Please recycle or re-use all of these materials after you receive your order!","policy_refunds":"WHAT&#39;S YOUR RETURN POLICY? \r\nWe stand behind all of our items and we believe you\u2019ll love them as much as we do!  If for any reason you aren&#39;t satisfied with your purchase, please let us know. You can send it back to us in its original, unused condition within 2 weeks of receiving it and we&#39;ll issue you a full refund. Buyer is responsible for return shipping costs. Personalized toys and custom orders are NOT returnable. In the event that a manufacturer&#39;s defect is found on any item, we&#39;ll take care of everything for you (be it a replacement, refund, or other accommodations). \r\n\r\nWHAT ABOUT SHIPPING ERRORS AND LOST PACKAGES?\r\nSorry, we can&#39;t be held responsible for shipping errors beyond our control such as delayed\/damaged\/lost packages or incorrect addresses provided by the buyer.\r\n\r\nWe package all of our toys very carefully and provide tracking\/delivery confirmation on all domestic orders, so shipping errors are very rare.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event that your package is lost in the mail, we will refund you for the cost of the toys (NOT including shipping fees).  For lost packages to be eligible for a refund minus shipping, you must notify us within 90 days of the shipping date.","policy_additional":"HOW DO I CONTACT YOU?\r\nEmail: SmilingTreeToys&lt;at&gt;gmail.com\r\nWebsite: www.SmilingTreeToys.com {launching Sept 2013}\r\nFacebook, Pinterest, & Twitter: SmilingTreeToys\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER GIFT NOTES AND WRAPPING?\r\nOur toys come ready-to-gift in USA-made cotton bags. These bags are ideal for gifting, storage, and travel.  If you like, we can add a handwritten gift note to the bag.  Just let us know what you want it to say in the \u201cNote to Seller\u201d when you checkout. We don&#39;t offer additional gift wrapping.\r\n\r\nDO YOU TAKE CUSTOM ORDERS?\r\nSometimes, depending on the specifics of your request.  Just contact us and we\u2019ll get talking.\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU COLOR YOUR WOODS?  WHAT FINISH DO YOU APPLY?\r\nWe never use stains, paints, or dyes. We use American grown hardwoods, and all of the gorgeous colors and grain patterns you see are 100% natural!  We simply coat them with our unique, homegrown finish: organic camelina oil (grown on our family&#39;s land) and local beeswax.  Our teethers come un-oiled, because less is more!\r\n\r\nCAN I GET MY TOYS WITHOUT THE ALL NATURAL OIL FINISH?\r\nYes, of course. Just tell us in the &#39;Note to Seller&#39; when you check out that you&#39;d like your toys unfinished.\r\n\r\nDO YOUR WOODEN TOYS SPLINTER?\r\nNo. We use only the finest, non-splintering American hardwoods and individually hand sand every piece so that it&#39;s silky smooth.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I CARE FOR MY SMILING TREE TOYS?\r\nAll of our items come with printed care for instructions. Because we use the finest in American hardwoods, our toys are very durable and require little care.  We do, however, have a few suggestions for keeping your toys in tippity-top shape. (We know you\u2019re busy parents, so don\u2019t worry - it only takes two minutes!)\r\n\r\nAll teethers are unfinished and non-splintering. Over time, as your little one chomps on them you may find they lose some of their smoothness. Simply use a dry kitchen scrubber pad or fine-grit sandpaper to bring them back to life. \r\n\r\nAll of our other toys are finished with our blend of homegrown organic camelina oil and beeswax.  We\u2019ve found this to be the best 100% organic and safe finish for protecting wood and preserving its natural beauty.  If you find your toys lose a bit of their smoothness or sheen, lightly hand sand with fine-grit sandpaper or a dry kitchen scrubber pad and re-finish with a food-grade oil.\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER GIFT CARDS?\r\nYes. You&#39;ll find listings for $25 and $50 Smiling Tree gift cards in our &#39;Wooden Toys&#39; section.  If you&#39;d like one in a different dollar amount, let us know.\r\n\r\nDO YOU SELL WHOLESALE?\r\nWe offer a limited portion of our product line for wholesale.  Email us at SmilingTreeToys&lt;at&gt;gmail.com to request current wholesale info.  We cannot take wholesale orders between August 1st and December 31st, as that&#39;s our busy retail time. Sorry!\r\n\r\nCAN I CREATE A SMILING TREE GIFT REGISTRY?\r\nSure! Many couples use Etsy&#39;s wedding registry as their baby registry. Simply create a wedding registry, add your favorite Smiling Tree Toys and other handmade goods, and share it with your family and friends.  It&#39;s super easy for anyone to navigate.  We promise!

Just let us know what you want it to say in the \u201cNote to Seller\u201d when you checkout. We don&#39;t offer additional gift wrapping.\r\n\r\nDO YOU TAKE CUSTOM ORDERS?\r\nSometimes, depending on the specifics of your request.  Just contact us and we\u2019ll get talking.\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU COLOR YOUR WOODS?  WHAT FINISH DO YOU APPLY?\r\nWe never use stains, paints, or dyes. We use American grown hardwoods, and all of the gorgeous colors and grain patterns you see are 100% natural!  We simply coat them with our unique, homegrown finish: organic camelina oil (grown on our family&#39;s land) and local beeswax.  Our teethers come un-oiled, because less is more!\r\n\r\nCAN I GET MY TOYS WITHOUT THE ALL NATURAL OIL FINISH?\r\nYes, of course. Just tell us in the &#39;Note to Seller&#39; when you check out that you&#39;d like your toys unfinished.\r\n\r\nDO YOUR WOODEN TOYS SPLINTER?\r\nNo. We use only the finest, non-splintering American hardwoods and individually hand sand every piece so that it&#39;s silky smooth.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I CARE FOR MY SMILING TREE TOYS?\r\nAll of our items come with printed care for instructions. Because we use the finest in American hardwoods, our toys are very durable and require little care.  We do, however, have a few suggestions for keeping your toys in tippity-top shape. (We know you\u2019re busy parents, so don\u2019t worry - it only takes two minutes!)\r\n\r\nAll teethers are unfinished and non-splintering. Over time, as your little one chomps on them you may find they lose some of their smoothness. Simply use a dry kitchen scrubber pad or fine-grit sandpaper to bring them back to life. \r\n\r\nAll of our other toys are finished with our blend of homegrown organic camelina oil and beeswax.  We\u2019ve found this to be the best 100% organic and safe finish for protecting wood and preserving its natural beauty.  If you find your toys lose a bit of their smoothness or sheen, lightly hand sand with fine-grit sandpaper or a dry kitchen scrubber pad and re-finish with a food-grade oil.\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER GIFT CARDS?\r\nYes. You&#39;ll find listings for $25 and $50 Smiling Tree gift cards in our &#39;Wooden Toys&#39; section.  If you&#39;d like one in a different dollar amount, let us know.\r\n\r\nDO YOU SELL WHOLESALE?\r\nWe offer a limited portion of our product line for wholesale.  Email us at SmilingTreeToys&lt;at&gt;gmail.com to request current wholesale info.  We cannot take wholesale orders between August 1st and December 31st, as that&#39;s our busy retail time. Sorry!\r\n\r\nCAN I CREATE A SMILING TREE GIFT REGISTRY?\r\nSure! Many couples use Etsy&#39;s wedding registry as their baby registry. Simply create a wedding registry, add your favorite Smiling Tree Toys and other handmade goods, and share it with your family and friends.  It&#39;s super easy for anyone to navigate.  We promise!

For those using PayPal, if your PayPal email address differs from your Etsy email address, both will be used.\r\n\r\nIf your pattern does not arrive within 24 hours of payment clearing, *please* contact me, as that generally means that I have sent your pattern, but it has gone to spam, or the wrong email address, or has otherwise not come through.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical items will be sent via USPS First Class mail unless other arrangements are made.

Designs!  This store is the ORIGINAL game piece seller on Etsy -- we&#39;ve been here doing business since March of 2010, getting better at what we do and adding more and more items to add to your board gaming fun!\n\nMy name&#39;s Tabitha, nice to have you here!  This shop is the creative outlet of a stay-at-home wife that has grown into a business.\n\nThe first question always is, what&#39;s an epicycle? Simple, actually -- a tiny circle on a larger circle.  An ancient astonomer, Ptolemy, used epicycles to explain the motion of the planets.  Though circles are very simple, the project of describing the huge planet&#39;s motions with those simple circles worked surprisingly well.\n\nI&#39;ve found that it sometimes it takes simple things like circles to remind us of the big things, like the planets.  It&#39;s a lofty goal, but I&#39;d like my little teeny-tiny game pieces to remind people of some of the really important stuff in life -- friends, family, and having fun.\n\nCreatively, I am highly inspired by my grandmother, who taught me how to crochet, weave, sew, and bake bread and cookies at a young age.\n\nSpiritually, Jesus is my all-in-all and sustains me both in daily life as well as in my creative endeavors.  \n\nIn all the rest of life, my husband is my love forever, my inspiration, my source of strength.  He deploys often as a Navy pilot, and working on things for this shop helps get me through some of the boredom and loneliness that comes with having him gone.  But we always look forward to playing games together again!","policy_payment":"I accept Paypal and Etsy&#39;s direct checkout as payment.  Items will only be shipped on receipt of completed payment.

I spent about four years working on what would become Iconica.\r\n\r\nThis boxed set includes the very first characters ever created for Iconica. It features wanderers, romantics, fighters and fools hailing from many different lands across the land of Veratar (see Explorer&#39;s Map item in our shop). Many of these archetypes play a role in the books and stories we&#39;re creating.\r\n\r\nIconica Series One is made up of 22 individual characters. Not only does this set include all of the cards in this series, it comes with additional game pieces, allowing for 4-player team games right out of the box.\r\n\r\nABOUT ICONICA\r\n\r\nIconica is an indie card game set within the World of Rynaga. Iconica blends strategy with a twist of chance for a card game experience in a category of its own. Intuitive gameplay, colorful characters and lots of backstory. It\u2019s more than a game, it\u2019s a journey.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll like Iconica if you:\r\n\r\n1. like games in which you&#39;re faced with choices (and some chance)\r\n2. want layers of complexity without reading 45 pages of rules \r\n3. like teaming up with friends during games\r\n4. want a NEW experience in a fictional setting\r\n5. want a game where there are no junk\/duplicate\/fodder cards\r\n6. like games with a rich backstory\r\n7. like games with RPG flavor\r\n\r\nDETAILS\r\n\r\nIconica Character Cards are professionally printed in small print runs. This Iconica Series One Box Set ships in a reusable box and includes the following:\r\n\r\n&gt; 22 Iconica Character Cards (character #1-22, depicted in the photos)\r\n&gt; 1 Iconica Quick Reference card\r\n&gt; 2 pairs of dice\r\n&gt; 2 sets of game pieces\r\n&gt; 2-player and 4-player Iconica rules\r\n\r\nCHARACTER LIST\r\n\r\n#1 \u2013 Featherune Sentinel\r\n#2 \u2013 Karkalan Dreadnaut\r\n#3

Please read the descriptions for each item on my site.

These Giclee prints range in paper size from 8x10 to 16x20 and are made in small batches or created when ordered, depending on the size. We do take requests for custom sizes so contact us for a quote.\r\n\r\nOPEN EDITION PRINTS may include similar art as limited edition prints, yet are characterized by differences in sizing, color, composition, detail level, vertical and horizontal orientation and paper quality. These prints are still created with the Giclee print-making method and are signed before shipping.\r\n\r\nCaring for Giclee Prints\r\n\r\nDo not handle prints with dirty or greasy hands. The paper is fragile and easily scratched, soiled and stained. Take care not to bend or crease the print as well. For best display results, position the art so that it receives a good amount of light. Using small picture lights or adjustable track lighting to place light on the image will give the art a whole new level of presence.\r\n\r\nBooks\r\n\r\nBooks are signed before they are shipped. If you are ordering the book as a gift, please let us know the name of the recipient so that Eric can personalize the message a bit more.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1351651680,"vacation_autoreply":"Hello!

Delivery for most shipments is estimated by the US Post Office at 7-10 days.

There have been instances of parcels taking 3-4 weeks to arrive. I have no control over the postal services and therefore cannot and will not guarantee arrival dates or give credit for delays in shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you order does not arrive within 30 days, I can place a claim with the US Post Office  for a lost parcel.

He likes to cause harmless trouble, play at inappropriate times (like when he should be napping)  and is the best at slinking around behind your back. His intentions are good, but sometimes something comes over this fellow and he has to sneak that extra cookie from the top shelf.\r\n\r\nXander comes with a mask and tail. This felt mask is adjustable with an elastic allowing It to expand and grow with your sly fox. The felt is soft on the skin. The tail is ment to hang off a belt with an attached loop.  Swing your tail with pride, stur up a storm as you play. Watch out everyone!

Most of my best ideas come from them, and from the need to keep them occupied. The concept of this shop is based on pretend play. Something that we lose site of in lieu of the television. I&#39;ve found that both my children love to dress up and become something else. I&#39;ve encouraged it by creating our own costumes. They can become someone else, in a different time, in a different place. \r\n\r\nFriends and family have loved receiving our kids birthday gifts for years. A felt cape with matching mask and cuffs for the boys and crowns and wands for the girls. They were a huge success! It was easy to see that there was a demand for such items. And beautifuly hand crafted to boot. Over the last few years I&#39;ve expanded my horizon.\r\n\r\n I love hand embroidery and like to do this when it is applicable. There is something about working with my own two hands that is so satisfying to me. I often envision a project even before the one in my hands is completed. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say I am always listening and watching my children for more inspiration.
